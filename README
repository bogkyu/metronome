This is a metronome program supposed to be run on cell phones.

It is a simple program, just to have a decent set of controls 
over the rythm.  I have no intention to fill it with white 
elephant features, just the bare necessity for music people 
who still needs such a helper device.

Motivation

I started writing this program because my son and I were in need 
of a metronome, as we were told by our guitar master.  Looking for 
a hardware version of a metronome, was not an option, and I found
no freeware version of a cell program to work with.  I decided that,
being able to write programs, I should not pay any amount of money
for the sake of convenience to buy a product of this kind, but try
to write one myself, one that should be free of charge.  I was 
thinking also at people out there being able to use my program, if
they find it appropriate to their needs.

This is the first time approaching J2ME API, and I found a lot 
difficult entering this, for me, new world.  For someone who tries 
this for the first time, I would reccomend the links bellow.

I found extremly useful the series of tutorial links from 

 http://www.roseindia.net/j2me/index.shtml

after first trying a couple of other links, such as:

or

I am using for now a sound from j2me-tk/AudioDemo application, bark.wav.
I'll create the necessary appropriate sound in time, to substitute
this one.
